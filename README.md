# SwiftiOS-list-manipulation
## Why focus on List?
List are great for presenting rows of data, but after a while scrolling loses its effcency. This project was created to master navigating complex arrays. The solution is to display content based on qualifying criteria such as a properties. In the example below; users can separate a master list of animals into three types. 
## When is this applicable?
Unlike a phone contact list where a user has a target in mind. This code presents options depending on users preference.This code is ideal for sifting items without  having a target.
## What was learned?
The lesson learned was manipulation of a list’s content.
