# SwiftiOS-list-manipulation
This project was built to reduce list size based on qualifying criteria such as a property. In the example below; user can separate a master list of animals into three types. 
Unlike a phone contact list where a user has a target in mind. This code presents options depending on users preference. 
The lesson learned was manipulation of a listâ€™s content.
